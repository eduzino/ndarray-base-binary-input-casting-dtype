## 🎉 Example Usage

You can use this tool in your Node.js projects. Here's a simple example of resolving the data type for an ndarray:

```javascript
const ndarray = require('ndarray');
const resolveDtype = require('ndarray-base-binary-input-casting-dtype');

const myArray = ndarray([1, 2, 3], [3]); // Create a simple 1D ndarray
const dtype = resolveDtype(myArray); // Automatically determine the data type

console.log(`The determined data type is: ${dtype}`);
```
